*Yield*: 10 servings<br>
*Prep Time*: 20 minutes<br>
*Cook Time*: 8 hours (slow cooker) / 1 hour (pressure cooker)<br>

# Ingredients
## Shredded Beef
- [ ] 2-3 pound boneless chuck or sirloin beef roast
- [ ] 2 cups low sodium beef broth
- [ ] 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- [ ] 1 cup salsa (red or green)
- [ ] teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] 1 teaspoon chili powder
- [ ] 1 teaspoon onion powder
- [ ] 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- [ ] 2 tablespoons cornstarch or flower

## Enchiladas
- [ ] 10 6- or 7-inch flour or corn tortillas
- [ ] 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- [ ] 1 1/2 cupps shredded Monterey Jack Cheese

# Instructions
1. Put the beef roast in the cooker of choice. Whisk together the broth, vinegar, salsa, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Pour over the roast. Cook according to the instructions below
   - **For the slow cooker**: use a 4- or 5-quart slow cooker, cover the slow cooker, and cook on low for 8-10 hours until the beef is tender and shreds easily
   - **For the Instant Pot/Electric Pressure Cooker**: use a 6-quart pressure cooker and cook on high for 60 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes (or all the way). Release the remaining pressure
2. Remove the roast and place in a large bowl or shallow pan (like 9x13-inch pan). Shred into bite-sized pieces with two forks.
3. Bring the liquid leftover from the rost to a simmer.
   - **For the slow cooker**: pour the liquid into a saucepan
   - **For the Instant Pot/Electric Pressure Cooker**: turn the instant pot to saut√©
4. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch (or flour) with about 2-3 tablespoons of water (use a bit more water if using flour). Add the slurry to the simmering liquid, whisking constantly, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thickened slightly (4-5 minutes). *Add additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed*.
5. Pour about 1/2 cup sauce in with the beef and toss. Use as desired (instructions for enchiladas below).
6. *To make enchiladas*: Spread about 1/2 cup sauce on the bottom of the 9x13-inch pan.
7. Toss the cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together.
8. Spread shredded beef in the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle with cheese. Roll up and place in the pan, seam-side down.
9. Spread 1-2 cups of sauce over the top of the enchiladas. Sprinkle with cheese.
10. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes until bubbly and hot. Let the enchiladas rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.
11. Sprinkle with fresh cilantro, if desired, and serve.

# Notes
**Serving Size**: *it kind of depends on how full you stuff each encilada (and the size of tortillas you use)... I've detailed the recipe for a 9x14-inch pan of enchiladas (about 10). If you used a slightly larger roast or used less meat mixture for each enchilada and have more enchiladas, simly fill up another pan and freeze before baking.*

**Freezable**: *the cooked, shredded beef freezes really well. Toss the beef with 1-2 cups sauce and freeze (in bags or covered containers). Assembled enchiladas freeze well, too. To bake from frozen, keep the pan covered and bake at 350 degrees for 45-60 minutes; uncover and bake until heated through and bubbly, another 20-30 minutes.*
