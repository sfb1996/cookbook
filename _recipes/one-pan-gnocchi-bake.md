*A single-dish, roasted vegetable and chickpea gnocchi dish that anyone can make!*

1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Put parchment paper on a baking sheet. 
3. Add "The Good Stuff" ingredients to the sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and coat with the other seasoning items. Toss until evenly mixed.
4. Bake for 25 minutes, until the tomatoes are burst and the gnocchi has a slight crisp. In the last few minutes, you can broil to brown the gnocchi and tomatoes a bit, if desired.
5. Serve immediately with fresh basil, balsamic glaze and vegan parmesan.

*NOTE: This recipe is sized to fit one pan, but we often double it.*

*NOTE: These are the things we like to put on it, but you can vary the vegetables or even remove the sausage to make it vegetarian!*

*NOTE: We prefer Green Goddess Dresing on top. You can also try vegan dill or tahini dip.*
