*This Tuscan Pasta only takes 20 minutes to throw together and makes the perfect freezer meal. With a creamy, cheesy garlic sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken, it will become a family favorite in no time.*

# Equipment
- Stock Pot (10 qt)
- Skillet
- Whisk
- Foil Pans (9" square)

# Instructions
1. Cook pasta acording to package directions. While it's cooking, prepare the sauce *(steps 2-3)*.
2. In a medium pot or skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time. Stir in the dried basil. Add the cream cheese, stirring with a whisk until the mixture is smooth. It will look curdled at first, but with constant whisking for 2-3 minutes, it will become a smooth creamy paste. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes.
3. Keep cooking over medium heat and add the milk and whisk quickly and constantly until it is blended into the sauce. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, pepper and salt. Cook over the medium heat, stirring until the cheese is melted and the sauce is the desired consistency, 5-10 minutes.
4. Serve sauce over hot, cooked noodles. I put my chicken on top, or you can mix it in.

# Notes
When making them into freezer meals - put the noodles, sauce, and chicken into two 9x9 foil tins. Wait until it cools down a little, place foil on top, and stick in the freezer. 
- To cook when frozen: bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes or until heated through. 
- To cook when frozen but thawed: bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until heated through.
