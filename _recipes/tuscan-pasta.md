*This Tuscan Pasta only takes 20 minutes to throw together and makes the perfect freezer meal. With a creamy, cheesy garlic sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken, it will become a family favorite in no time.*

# ingredients:
- [ ] 16 oz bow tie pasta (1 box)
- [ ] 4 tbsp butter
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic (finely minced or pressed through a garlic press)
- [ ] 1/2 tbsp dried basil
- [ ] 8 oz cream cheese (softened and cut into small cubes)
- [ ] 8 oz sun dried tomatoes (1 jar - rinsed, drained, and chopped)
- [ ] 2 cups milk
- [ ] 8 oz parmesan cheese (grated)
- [ ] 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt (more to taste if needed)
- [ ] 1 cup chicken (cooked and cubed)

## Equipment
- Stock Pot (10 qt)
- Skillet
- Whisk
- Foil Pans (9" square)

# Instructions
1. Cook pasta acording to package directions. While it's cooking, prepare the sauce *(steps 2-3)*.
2. In a medium pot or skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time. Stir in the dried basil. Add the cream cheese, stirring with a whisk until the mixture is smooth. It will look curdled at first, but with constant whisking for 2-3 minutes, it will become a smooth creamy paste. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes.
3. Keep cooking over medium heat and add the milk and whisk quickly and constantly until it is blended into the sauce. Stir in the Parmesan cheese, pepper and salt. Cook over the medium heat, stirring until the cheese is melted and the sauce is the desired consistency, 5-10 minutes.
4. Serve sauce over hot, cooked noodles. I put my chicken on top, or you can mix it in.
