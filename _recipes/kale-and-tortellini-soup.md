# Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pound mild Italian sausage, casing removed
- [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- [ ] 6 garlic cloves, minced
- [ ] 1 quart chicken stock
- [ ] 1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- [ ] 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- [ ] 1 teaspoon sea salt
- [ ] 1 bunch curly kale, stemmed and roughly torn
- [ ] 10 ounces fresh tortellini 
- [ ] 1 cup heavy cream

*Optional*
- [ ] Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, for serving (optional)

# Instructions
1. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, onion, and garlic and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until the sausage is browned and the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Drain off any excessive fat.
2. Whisk in the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste until fully incorporated. Bring to a boil and add the salt, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. Stir in the kale, tortellini, and cream. Cook until the kale is wilted and the pasta is tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan and red pepper flakes, if desired, before serving.
