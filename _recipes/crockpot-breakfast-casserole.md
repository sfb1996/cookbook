1. If using bacon or sausage, cook and crumble. Drain fat leaving 1 tablespoon in the pan.
2. If desired, soften the onion in the fat. This is optional but will soften the flavor of the onion.
3. Grease a 6qt slow cooker. Place half the hash browns, meat, onions, peppers, and cheese in the slow cooker. Repeat layers ending with cheese, do not stir.
4. Whisk eggs, milk, and seasonings in a medium bowl. Pour the egg mixture over the ingredients in the slow cooker.
5. Cook on low for 7 to 8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. Once cooked, uncover and let the casserole rest for 15 minutes.

# Notes

**Hashbrowns**: You can use shredded or diced hashbrowns in this recipe. Diced hashbrowns have more of a ‘potato’ texture. Use hash browns from frozen, thawed hash browns will cook faster.

**Onion**: For a milder onion flavor, cook the onion in a bit of bacon fat or olive oil before adding the to the slow cooker.

**Cooking Time**: Cooking time can vary slightly based on your slow cooker. If the casserole is done cooking early, turn the slow cooker to warm and let it rest for up to 1 hour before serving. If using bacon or sausage, you may see a little bit of fat along the edges of the slow cooker, and there will be a little bit of liquid along the edges and perhaps on top. This is expected and most of the liquid will evaporate as the casserole rests.
