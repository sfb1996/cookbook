# Instructions
## Prep Work
1. Drain and reserve the juice from the diced tomatoes, we’ll use the liquid to deglaze that skillet after searing the chicken. (You should have about 1⁄4 cup.)
2. Combine the chickenbroth, heavycream, honey, hotsauce, and seasonings and set aside.

## Make the Chicken
1. Slice the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. Cover with saran wrap and use the textured side of a meat mallet to pound it to 1⁄2 inch thick.
2. Season each side with Cajun seasoning. Sprinkle with flour and rub it over the surface of each side. (The flour gives it a little texture and prevents it from sticking to the skillet. It also thickens the sauce a little more at the end.)
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken in batches for 4-5 minutes per side, until a golden crust has developed. Set aside.

## Make the Sauce
1. Add the reserved juice from the tomatoes and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to clean the bottom and sides of the skillet, the “fond” will add more flavor to the sauce.
2. Add the butter and the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
3. Add the flour and stir continuously for 2 minutes, until the raw flour smell is cooked off.
4. Add the chicken broth mixture in small splashes, stirring continuously. (This is the mixture that we combined in step 1 of prep work.)
5. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce to a gentle bubble. Add the drained tomatoes and let it simmer and reduce for 5-7 minutes. During this time the flavors will meld, and the sauce will thicken and concentrate.
6. Reduce heat to low. Slowly sprinkle in the cheese, stirring continuously, until melted and combined. Slowly stir in the lime juice.
7. Add the chicken back and spoon the sauce on top. Let it simmer and reduce for 4 minutes, uncovered. Add the fresh lime wedges to the skillet and simmer for 1 more minute. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with rice, beans, or salad! (See notes for rice cooking tips.)

# Notes
## Pro Tips:
**Cajun Seasoning**: I use McCormick Cajun Seasoning, consider using reduced or no sodium seasoning if preferred.
Hot Sauce: I use Frank's Hot Sauce for this recipe.

**Tomatoes**: If you can’t eat tomatoes, use 1⁄4 cup dry white wine or chicken broth to deglaze the skillet after searing the chicken.

**Cheese**: Cheddar Jack, Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and Mozzarella are all great options for this, I like to use a combination of cheeses. Shred it from a block, packaged shredded cheese doesn’t melt quite as well. If using mozzarella, use low moisture/whole milk.

**Heat Level**: For less heat, use just 1 tsp. of hot sauce and omit the cayenne/red pepper flakes. You can also use regular diced tomatoes instead of Rotel with green chilies. Additions: Black beans and/or corn can also be added to this dish, you can add them when the tomatoes are added.

## Storage:
Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Leftovers do freeze fairly well!
If reheating from frozen: Thaw leftover chicken overnight in the fridge (or defrost it in the microwave) and then bake it in a small, lightly greased, covered casserole dish at 350° for 20-25 minutes.

## My Process for Perfectly Cooked Rice:
- Bring 2 cups chicken broth to a boil. Add 1 cup white long grain rice and bring it back to a boil.
- Cover tightly and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes. Turn heat off.
- Optional: Remove from heat and let the rice sit in the pot, covered, for 10 full minutes. Any rice stuck to the bottom will release during this time.

This will yield 3 cups of flavorful rice.

*Note: Other varieties of rice will require different amounts of liquid and simmering time.*
