# Ingredients:
- [ ] 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] 12 eggs
- [ ] 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- [ ] 2 cups small curd cottage cheese
- [ ] 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, and drained
- [ ] 2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles
- [ ] 1/2 cup melted butter
- [ ] 2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts

# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 

2. Parbake the pie crusts for 10 minutes.

3. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.

4. Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth. Whisk in flour mixture until no lumps remain. Stir in the Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, cottage cheese, spinach, green chiles, and melted butter until evenly blended. Divide mixture between pie crusts.

5. Bake quiches in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until quiches are lightly browned, and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.

# Tips
You can add other meats or veggies to this recipe to suit your taste. Sometimes I add a small package of chopped ham to the recipe.

This quiche can be baked with or without pie shells.
