# Ingredients

{% tabs ingredient-list %}

{% tab ingredient-list Small %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab ingredient-list Large %}
- [ ] 5-6 eggs (it really doesn’t make a difference, especially if they are large eggs)

- [ ] 1 tsp salt
{% endtab %}

# Instructions
1. Mix with wire whip - you don’t want too much air in it.  There should be a few little lumps.
2. Very lightly grease a Teflon frying pan.  Spoon batter onto hot pan, and spread it with the back of the spoon to make about a 6" circle.  (These are really just crepes, only thicker).  When the top looks dry, flip it over to brown on the other side.  
3. Use your imagination - our kids like to spread a little melted butter on, then sprinkle some powdered sugar, then roll up and eat it.  Warm cinnamon applesauce is very good, scrambled eggs, etc.  Anything you can think of.  Fruit and whipping cream is yummy.
