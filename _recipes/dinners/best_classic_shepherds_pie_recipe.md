- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves -minced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
- [ ] 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- [ ] 1 cup beef broth
- [ ] 1 cup frozen mixed peas & carrots (see note 1)
- [ ] 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels

**Potato Topping:**
- [ ] 1 1/2 - 2 lb. russet potatoes -about 2 large potatoes peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes

# Instructions

**Make the potato topping**

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.
2. Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.
3. Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.
4. Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.

6. Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden
spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.
7. Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.
8. Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.
9. Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
10. Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

11. Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
12. If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn’t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes (see note 2). Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

# Notes
1. If you can’t find frozen mixed peas and carrots, you could use 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup frozen sliced carrots.
2. Bake at 400° F. Start preheating the oven after you make the meat mixture (listed in step 6).
