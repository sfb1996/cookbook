# Instructions
1. Cook chicken breasts, skin, bone, and dice; set aside. (May be done in advance and refrigerated, covered).
2. In large bowl combine soup, chili peppers, sour cream, and green onions. Add Jack cheese. Remove 2 cups of the mixture and add diced chicken to the 2 cups.
3. Place the chicken mixture into the tortillas, not too full, and roll them up. Place the enchiladas into 2 large dripper pans so they are somewhat separated.
4. Spoon remaining soup mixture over the top and cover with shredded cheddar cheese.
5. Cover tightly with tin foil and bake at 350 degrees F for 40 to 50 minutes or until hot and bubbly.

*NOTE: Casseroles can be made a day or two ahead (this adds to flavor) and refrigerated, uncooked, until the time to bake. You can also use canned chicken.
