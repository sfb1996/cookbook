# Crust
- [ ] 2 cups crushed pretzels (The smaller straight ones work best)
- [ ] 3/4 cup melted butter
- [ ] 3 Tsp sugar

1. Crush pretzels (putting them a Ziplock bag and crushing with a rolling pin works well). You want them in small pieces, but not just crumbs.
2. Mix pretzels, sugar, and melted butter.
3. Press into a 9x13 glass dish.
4. Bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.
5. Cool completely.

# Filling
- [ ] 1 (8 oz) cream cheese
- [ ] 1 cup sugar
- [ ] 1 medium-size Cool Whip

1. Mix together cream cheese and sugar until smooth.
2. Fold in Cool Whip.
3. Spread evenly on top of cooled pretzel crust, making sure to seal the edges completely.

# Topping
- [ ] 1 (6 oz) box strawberry Jello
- [ ] 2 (10 oz) frozen sliced strawberries (not the ones with added sugar)
- [ ] 2 cups boiling water

1. Dissolve Jello in boiling water.
2. Add frozen strawberries (the hot water will melt them).
3. Let stand for 10 minutes.
4. Pour mixture onto cream cheese layer.
5. Refrigerate for two hours.

*Note: I have also used fresh strawberries, sliced. In that case I used two cups boiling water, then added ice to thicken the Jello, and then added the strawberries.*
