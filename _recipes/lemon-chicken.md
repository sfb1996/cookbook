1. Gather all ingredients.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season chicken thighs evenly with salt
and pepper on both sides.
3. Heat oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Add chicken thighs to skillet, skin
sides down, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes total. Transfer chicken
thighs to a plate; set aside. Do not wipe skillet clean.
4. Add garlic to drippings in the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 10 to 20 seconds.
Add rice, cream of chicken soup, lemon juice, lemon zest, tarragon, and crushed red pepper;
whisk to combine. Gradually add broth, whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.
Arrange chicken thighs, skin sides up, over rice mixture and place lemon slices over chicken
thighs. Cover tightly with aluminum foil or lid, and transfer to the preheated oven.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is cooked through and a thermometer inserted into
thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 30 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven. Stir rice mixture, and sprinkle with parsley. Divide chicken, lemon
slices, and rice evenly among 4 plates. Garnish with
additional tarragon and crushed red pepper.
