*Note: All chocolate bars will work, and we've even used reese's peanut butter cups (1/2 peanut butter cup per s'more cup)*

# Instructions
1. Mix graham gracker crumbs, powdered sugar, and melted butter together until crubly and evenly mixed.
2. Put a small scoop of these crumbs in each cup of a mini-muffin tin and press down and up the sides to form a little "cup."
3. Bake at 350 for 4-5 minutes - or until the edges are bubbling.
4. While the cups are baking, break apart the candy bar into sections and cut the marshmallows in half (scissors dipped in cold water works well for this).
5. Remove the cups from the oven and put a square of chocolate in each crumb cup. Then top with a marshmallow half.
6. Return to the oven for 1-2 minutes or until the marshmallow is just slightly puffed.
7. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing them. Then cool completely.
8. Melt the remaining chocolate (microware works well) and dip the top of the completely cooled S'more Cups into the melted chocolate. Let them sit for about an hour to "set" the chocolate.
