1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare a large sheet pan by lightly greasing. Place the chicken thighs in a large bowl.
2. Whisk together the marinade: oil, mustard, garlic, oregano, thyme, and sea salt. Reserve a few tbsp, and pour the rest over the chicken thighs.
3. White the chicken marinates for about 10 minutes, prep the veggies. Dice up the potatoes and peppers into small chunks. Create slices of red onion. You can leave the cherry tomatoes whole.
4. Spread the veggies over the sheet pan and top with the few tbsp of marinade. Toss to combine and ensure everything is well coated.
5. Nestle the chicken breast on top of the vegetables and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast for 25 minutes.
6. At the 25 minute mark, remove the sheet pan and quickly add in the artichoke hearts, capers, and feta. Bake for another 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is golden and veggies are roasted.
7. Remove from oven and top with basil. Salt to taste and serve hot!
